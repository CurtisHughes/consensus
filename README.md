# Consensus
Consensus is a collaborative application for users to anonymously create, share, and mark their availability for an event. The site will track each users responses and suggest the best date to host an event. All actions within the site are performed using Firebase's anonymous user authentication. Which means users don't have to log in or share their email (even to create a poll!). Just provide an event name and description, then share the link provided on the event page to allow anyone to vote.

The publicly available site is hosted at https://consensus.curtishughes.net. Feel free to create polls and ask for responses there, but if you would prefer to roll your own instance please follow the steps outlined in the [self-hosting documentation](./docs/self-hosting.md).

If you would like to contribute to this Consensus repository please follow the [contributing documentation](./docs/contributing.md) to setup a local environment.
